## 🧚 Final Whisper
This is not just a **course** — it’s an invitation.  
To see the camera not just as a tool, but as a pen.  
To see the edit not just as a technique, but as a rhythm.  
And to see yourself — not just as a user, but as a **creator of feeling**.

May these chapters lead you gently but surely to a voice only you can shape. 🌸🎞️
